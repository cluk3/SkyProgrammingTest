Usage
-----

Before delving into the descriptions of each available npm script, here's a brief summary of the three which will most likely be your bread and butter:

* Doing live development? Use `npm start` to spin up the dev server.
* Compiling the application to disk? Use `npm run compile`.
* Deploying to an environment? `npm run deploy` can help with that.

Great, now that introductions have been made here's everything in full detail:

|`npm run...`|Description|
|---|---|
|`start`|Spins up Koa server to serve your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon to automatically restart the server when server-related code is changed.|
|`dev:nw`|Same as `npm run dev`, but opens the redux devtools in a new window.|
|`dev:no-debug`|Same as `npm run dev` but disables redux devtools.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`test:frontend`|Runs Karma to test the frontend application; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`test:frontend:watch`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`test:backend`|Runs Mocha to test the backend application; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`test:backend:watch`|Runs Mocha and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`deploy`|Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.|
|`deploy:dev`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "development".|
|`deploy:prod`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "production".|
|`flow:check`|Analyzes the project for type errors.|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.js` files.|
